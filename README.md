## Employee Retention Prediction
This project contains a Python notebook used to train and compare multiple machine learning models to predict whether an employee will stay or leave a company, based on HR data. The dataset includes features such as:
 - satisfaction_level
 - last_evaluation
 - number_project
 - average_monthly_hours
 - tenure
 - work_accident
 - promotion_last_5years
 - salary
 - department
 - left (target variable)

 ## Models used
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

Each model was trained and evaluated using cross-validation and multiple performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score). The goal was to identify the most effective approach for predicting employee attrition.
